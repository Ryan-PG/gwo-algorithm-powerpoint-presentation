# Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) Algorithm

## Overview

This repository contains information and resources related to the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm, which is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that mimics the social hierarchy and hunting mechanism of grey wolves.

## Presentation Slides

The presentation slides for this algorithm were created for a university class and are included in the repository. You can find them in root directory of this repository. For better experience use powerpoint +2017.

## Algorithm Description

The Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm is a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the social behavior and hunting strategy of grey wolves. It was proposed by Dr. Seyedali Mirjalili. For detailed information about the algorithm, refer to the presentation slides or visit Dr. Mirjalili's website:
